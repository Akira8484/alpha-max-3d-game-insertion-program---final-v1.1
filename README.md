# alpha-max-3d-game-insertion-program---final-v1.1
 This is my first GitHub project and my first python program, it's a fairly simple script and will be improved on as I learn more about python and SQLite statements

This is a command line program is to make it easier to add entries to the games.db file for the Alpha Max 3D game board.
The Alpha Max 3D game board is a Pandora box style game board manufactured by OneMoreTech. This game board does not come with an easy way to add more games(roms). The current method to add games is to manually open and add new entries one by one to multiple tables in the games.db file and copy the roms to the appropriate directory. This program will allow you to add multiple new entries to the necessary tables without having to open the database file.

To use this program copy the alpha-max-3d-game-insertion-program.exe (windows users) or alpha-max-3d-game-insertion-program.py file (Linux or others with python installed) to the /res folder where the games.db file is located on your alpha max 3d SD card. 
Double click the. .exe (or run the python) file and follow the on screen prompts.
It will ask you for some information such as ROM name, file extension, display name, location (on the SD card) of the appropriate ROM folder, emulator number etc.
The user still needs to know the appropriate information to enter, and the user needs to do it correctly for it to work properly.
It will take the information you inputted and automatically insert it into the games.db file.
You then need to copy your ROM and movie files to the appropriate folders on the SD card.
remove your SD card, put it back in the alpha max game board, power it on and your newly added games should be displayed on the games list, and if you did everything correctly will be fully functional.

On future versions I will work on automating more of the process so it will require less user input.

The Alpha Max game board is available to order from the manufacturer or if you are in the USA you can order from my website: mrmattsarcade.com/shop
